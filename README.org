* The idea

  I intend to use this repository (and also this README file) as a tool to
  organize myself and my configurations. That way I can incrementally rip
  whatever I like from my Manjaro configs, store it here and perhaps some day in
  the near future distro-hop to Arch (either that or use Manjaro Architect).
